    "# Turn on one or two LEDs in Moore style\n",
    "We would like to implement a piece of hardware that can turn on and off two LEDs. If we only used combinatorial logic, one would have to keep the button pressed to have the light on, needless to say, this would be unpractical for lights in a room. With the power of FSM we can keep the light on without keeping the button pressed. To make the implementation a little more interesting, we would like to enable two light intensities. This will be implemented by having two LEDs turn on by double-tapping the button within 0.5 seconds. To keep track of when 0.5 seconds have passed we are going to use a counter. As Basys3 has a frequency of 100MHz, this means that  $50*10^6$ clock tick will occur in 0.5 seconds. We will initially implement this a Moore style FSM. Recall that Moore type FSM produces outputs based on the state alone, whereas Mealy type produces output based on the current state and inputs.\n",

    "We want two LEDs to be on in state twoLightOnPressed and twoLightOn.\n",
