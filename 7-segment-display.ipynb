    "The first step is to design a datapath. To do this you need to determine what data you need to store and manipulate.  This defines the registers in the datapath. By data we mean variables and not constants. Constants in hardware is just a matter of connecting signals to Vdd and Ground. Then you determine what operations you need to perform on the data. An operation is performed during a clock cycle and some example operations are *sum <= sum + 5* or *sum <= sum - price*. List all the operations that your datapath should be capable of performing. Based on this list of clock-cycle operations and the list of registers you should be able to design a datapath. There is a lot of freedom and many alternatives. In our case it should suffice to be able to do one single arithmetic operation in a clock cycle, i.e., to use only one single adder/subtractor in the datapath. When the datapath is in place, the next step is to design the finite state machine that will control the sequence of operations in the datapath and deliver the output signals *release_can* and *alarm*.\n",
    "In summary, the design phase involves the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A list of registers and “clock cycle operations” to be supported by the datapath\n",
    "* A diagram showing an intended datapath design (registers, multiplexers, adders/subtractors etc.)\n",
    "* A complete ASM-chart specification of the central processing unit or a state-graph of the FSM.\n",
    "* A test sequence for simulating your design (a timing diagram and/or a Chisel PeekPokeTester).\n",
    "\n",
    "A comment about the input signals: You should be aware of the fact that the signals will be asserted for as many clock cycles as you push the buttons and switches. For *reset* and *buy* this is what you want and need to deal with. For signals *coin2* and *coin5* you do not want to add *2 kr.* or *5 kr.* for as many cycles as you push the corresponding button. To avoid this the FSM in your *vending_machine_cpu* must respond to the rising edge and wait for the corresponding signal to be de-asserted\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now describe your *vending_machine_cpu* in Chisel. You can either do this in a new module or extend the top module in the bottom. You should keep the state machine and data path seperated. This makes it easier to work on and debug.\n",
