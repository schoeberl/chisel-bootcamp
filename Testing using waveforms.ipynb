    "# Testing using waveforms\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will see how to use the PeekPokeTester and the most powerful tool for debugging hardware; the waveform. When runnning the PeekPokeTester, we can either inspect the outputs which we peek, but this does not tell us a lot about what is actually happenning. Therefore, it is also possible to output a VCD (Value Change Dump) file, which contains the waveform for the generated hardware signals. This allows us to find exactly which signal is behaving wrong and we can then backtrack to find the source of the problem.\n",

As you see no end on your assignment you don't want to spend time ordering the pizza. Luckily your friend has written a Chisel code that describes a piece of hardware that can order your favourite pizza with only one press of a button. After having pressed the button and waited an hour without any pizza being delivered, you figure that there must be a bug in his hardware. To show your friend your superior hardware and Chisel knowledge you decide to fix his code. As documentation your friend has provided a FSM diagram, and the following description of the logic in each state.\n",
