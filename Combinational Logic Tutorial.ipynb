    "The first Chisel keyword to be introduced is *Module* and *IO*.  \n",
    "When declaring a class extending Module, it means that this code will be mapped to a Verilog module. Verilog modules are equivalent to components in VHDL. You start a Module description by declaring the inputs and outputs of the module. This is done using the special keyword *IO*. Declaring IO is equivalent to declaring the entity of a component in VHDL. All signals declared in IO must be specified as either an input or an output, this is done by wrapping the signals in the Input() and Output() apply methods (see code below). The IO declared in the empty module *HardwareModule* has signals from the three basic chisel data types; UInt - unsigned integer, SInt - signed integer and Bool - boolean. You specify the with of the signal bus explicitly using the X.W with x being an integer larger than 0. You cannot set the with of a Bool as it represents a single wire. If you need a bus and don't interpret it as an integer use UInt anyway. Inspect the code below. "
